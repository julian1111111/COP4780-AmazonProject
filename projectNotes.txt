two modes: inventory and cart
both have create, read all
update is different: changes item info in inventory mode, changes quantity of an item in cart mode
delete is different: delete item from inventory, move all of an item from cart to inventory

two different menus
two different lists of products

same command options in each menu

could have a menu function that takes bool inventoryMode as parameter
also separate inventory and cart operations (switch statements) functions

menu is displayed for appropriate mode, input read and sent to appropriate switch

program so far:
- reads for i or s
- prints correct menu
- takes input again
- depending on bool inventoryMode, sends new input to appropriate function

want:
- only display mode menu once after switching modes, while in same mode only display mode name

could:
- add bool parameter to printMenu
- check if inventory mode changed from start of loop to end of loop

- inventory mode is either true or false at beginning of loop
- inventory mode is either unchanged or opposite value at end of loop

updating number of an item in cart:
- find the item quantity in inventory
- find the item quantity in cart
- (adding) if desired quantity is larger than current cart quantity: difference = desired - current
- (subtracting) if desired quantity is less than current cart quantity: difference = current - desired

- new cart quantity (adding): current + difference
- new inventory quantity (adding): current - difference

- new cart quantity (subtracting): current - difference
- new inventory quantity(subtracting): current + difference
